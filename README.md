Personal Portfolio Web Page
This project is a personal portfolio webpage designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. Built using HTML and CSS, the webpage demonstrates my ability to structure content using semantic HTML and style it with modern CSS techniques. The project is deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible online.

Features
1. Semantic HTML Structure
The webpage uses semantic HTML elements like <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> for a clear and accessible structure.
Organized into five main sections:
Header: Contains my name and a navigation bar with links to different sections.
About: Includes a profile picture and a brief bio.
Projects: Showcases two projects with images and descriptions.
Contact: Features a contact form where users can input their name, email, and a message.
Footer: Displays copyright information.
2. CSS Styling
An external CSS file is used to style the webpage for consistency and maintainability.
Key styling features include:
Custom fonts and text styles for readability.
Defined color schemes for backgrounds, text, and hover effects.
Class, ID, and universal selectors for precise and reusable styling.
Proper use of display modes (block, inline, flexbox) for layout and alignment.
3. Responsiveness
The webpage is fully responsive, ensuring it displays well on various screen sizes.
Media queries are used to adjust styles for smaller screens, improving user experience on mobile devices.
4. Interactive Features
A functional contact form includes fields for name, email, and a message, styled for usability.
Hyperlinks allow users to:
Send an email using a mailto: link.
Call a phone number using a tel: link.
Buttons and links have hover effects to enhance interactivity.
